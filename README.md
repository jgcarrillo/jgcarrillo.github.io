### âœ¨ Explanation

Welcome to my new website (same design, **different static generator**). I decided to move to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) because I felt more comfortable working with node_modules and json files instead of Ruby and Gems. This is just a migration but I have implemented some features.

### ðŸŽ¨ Features

-   Dependabot for npm dependencies and GitHub Actions.
-   Better implementation of JavaScript helpers, mainly date functions, so I don't have to change it manually.
-   I decided to remove the **Blog** section because I don't want to spend all my time writing posts that no one is going to read.

### ðŸš€ Installation

-   Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jgcarrillo/jgcarrillo.github.io.git`
-   Compose the Node modules: `npm install`
-   Dev server: `npm run dev`
