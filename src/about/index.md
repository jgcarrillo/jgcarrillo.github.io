Hi, I'm **Jorge** and I'm a software developer. I'm currently studying Web Development in a two year course here in Murcia (Spain). You can find me on internet as **jgcarrillo** or jorsparrow. At first I was Building Engineer (like an architect but more technical). I have been working in different companies such as Real State or as a freelancer.

At the moment I'm very keen on JavaScript, and I can get pretty enthusiastic defending good HTML/CSS practises. My goal for the next few years is to start my professional career as a Web Developer, no matter if I work as front-end or back-end.

If you are interested in contact with me, you can send me an email at `jorgegomezweb (at) gmail.com`
