Like any other Gen Y kid, I grew up with **Pokemon anime series, Game Boy cartridges** and a computer (a Pentium I think) that only ran emulators and not games like Age of Empires or Call of Duty. I remember those years with love, spending every afternoon on the computer, cracking a few games, **trying to code in Java** and downloading a wide variety of games.

I don't know why, but I studied Building Engineering (like an architect but more technical), that allows me to work in different companies such as **Real State or as a freelancer**. Over time, I realized that my passion was different, so I decided to move on software development.

**I'm currently studying** Web Development in a two year course here in Murcia (Spain). At the moment I'm very keen on JavaScript, static site generators (Jekyll or 11ty), Ruby on Rails and Vue, and I can get pretty enthusiastic defending good HTML/CSS practises. My goal for the next few years is to start my professional career as a Web Developer, no matter if I work as front-end or back-end developer.
