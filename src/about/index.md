Like any other Gen Y kid, I grew up with **Pokemon anime series, Game Boy cartridges** and a computer (a Pentium I think) that only ran emulators and not games like Age of Empires or Call of Duty. I remember those years with love, spending every afternoon on the computer, cracking a few games, **trying to code in Java** and downloading a wide variety of games.

I don't know why, but I studied Building Engineering (like an architect but more technical), that allows me to work in different companies such as **Real State or as a freelancer**. Over time, I realized that my passion was different, so I decided to move on software development.

I studied **Higher Technician in Web Applications Development** here in Murcia (Spain). At the moment I'm very keen on JavaScript, Vue and Laravel and I'm quite excited defending good programming practises.
