-   This web is made with **11ty**, a JAMStack framework for build static websites. The code is [here](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/jgcarrillo.github.io). I also have an old version made with Jekyll [available here](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/jekyll-personal-web).

-   **TrelloJS Clone** made with HTML, CSS (Grid Layout). I did this project in order to improve my skills with JavaScript and use of DOM. The [code is in my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/trello-js-app).

-   I made a basic interface that displays current time, custom greetings and weather based on **Open Weather Map API**. You can see all about it [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/weather-time-display).

-   Continued with Vanilla JavaScript, I have made a web that allows you to upload an image and download it again with a **custom background**, without any server. [Just check the code and tell me what you think!](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/javascript-image-uploader).

-   I have a bunch of projects in my **Codepen profile**. There are several webs made with JavaScript and Bootstrap. Do you want the code? [here it is](https://codepen.io/jgcarrillo/)
