## Featured projects{.proyectos-destacados}

- My biggest project is **Reverse Recipes**, an app made with Laravel, Vue, Tailwind, InertiaJS and JetStream to fetch recipes by ingredient, user management and more. [Just take a look!](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/reverse-recipes)

- **Telegram Resume Bot**. Made with NodeJS and deployed on Netlify. You can check it out if you type _@JGCarrilloResumeBot_ in Telegram.

- This web is made with **11ty**, a JAMStack framework for build static websites. The code is [here](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/jgcarrillo.github.io). I also have an old version made with Jekyll [available here](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/jekyll-personal-web).

- **TrelloJS Clone** made with HTML, CSS (Grid Layout). I did this project in order to improve my skills with JavaScript and use of DOM. The [code is in my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/trello-js-app).

- I made a basic interface that displays current time, custom greetings and weather based on **Open Weather Map API**. You can see all about it [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/weather-time-display).

- Continued with Vanilla JavaScript, I have made a web that allows you to upload an image and download it again with a **custom background**, without any server. [Just check the code and tell me what you think!](https://github.com/jgcarrillo/javascript-image-uploader).
