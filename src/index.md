Welcome to my website! I'm a software developer based in Murcia (Spain), the city of sun!. This web is the entry point to all the things I do about **software development**.

For further information about my profile, you can check it out at **[Linkedin](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jgcarrilloweb)**. But, if you want to know how I work, I highly recommend you to see the [about](/about) section, there you can see so many good projects that I have done to improve my skills and also to experiment with different technologies.

Apart from software development, **[reading](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-hvx2dSsVgYn2t4nzhm93-SMDlxsCCbJdo7xiuFKLGY/edit?usp=sharing)** is one of my hobbies. Some of my favorite genres are history and personal growth books. If I have to choose one, **The Count of Monte Cristo** by Alexandre Dumas is one of my favourite books.
